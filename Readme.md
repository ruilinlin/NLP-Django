# BERT-Base Text Classification Model

## Project Description

This repository contains a BERT-based text classification model implemented using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is designed to classify text into predefined categories. This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for text classification tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bert-classification.git
   cd bert-classification
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
### Training the model

1. dataset:
    cdconv.txt
2.
